# Tone Row Maximalism

### Introduction

	Greetings. If you are reading this, you have stumbled upon a passion project of mine that I have been working on for some time. My goal with this project is to develop a reasonably efficient commandline application that takes a variety of options and turns out tone rows of various types. I am doing this not because it is novel, but because it has been useful to my developement in writing code. 

### Objectives

 - Functionality
	- Takes commandline input to decide between options
	- Can generate a single tone row
	- Generates all transformations
		- Retrograde
		- Inversion
		- Inverted Retrograde
		- Transpositions of all
	- All answers generated in numerical form 

### Filestructre

### To Do
 - [x] How tf am i gonna structure this filesystem.
 - [ ] Consolidate scripts into functions
 - [ ] Remove unecessary files
 - [ ] 


### Files that need to be incorporated
